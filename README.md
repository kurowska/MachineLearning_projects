# MachineLearning_projects

With the use of devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large 
amount of data about personal activity. These devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ people who 
take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health and/or to find patterns in their behavior. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely 
quantify how well they do it. The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, 
arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict how well they do the excercises. They were asked to perform barbell 
lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

More information about this data is available from the website here: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> 
(section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). The data for this project also come from this site.

The MachineLearningProject.md file is complete and corresponds to the MachineLearningProject.html (which GitHub 
sees as too big to display). Therefore the .md file is recommended for viewing.
